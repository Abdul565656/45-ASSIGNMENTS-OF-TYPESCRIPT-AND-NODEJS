// 22. Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.
// Original array
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Accessing an index that doesn't exist to intentionally cause an index error
console.log(numbers[10]); // This will produce an index error since the array only has 5 elements
